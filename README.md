# plug-export

## Purpose
This repository contains two scripts, each of which pulls a specific type of song from a generated `PLUG_PLAYLISTS.json` file. As the YouTube API is slow and cannot handle as many songs as some may have in their Plug playlists, these scripts can help to separate the SoundCloud songs out completely, and the YouTube songs out by playlists, so that they can be sent to their respective websites through the PYE tool.
